# OBJCENTER TOOL

### Description 

This project was a training project to create my first C++ project that is applicable to my field using the knowledge I have acquired in pipeline td training.

### The problem

The biggest issue was transfering my scripting knowledge from Python into a programming language like C++ while referencing online course, AI, and friends.

I wanted to give myself a practical challenge that could be used as a practical portfolio piece and adjusting OBJ files seem ideal for the task.

The second biggest challenge outside of the logic and syntax, was the process on centering a piece of geometry using code. I enjoy using simple algebra and process of loops to centering my object.

### Challenges

My first challenge was navigating with the data types and order of establishing functions, and classes in the right order. Also struggled but adapted fairly fast to the difference between variables and classes.

My second biggest challenge was produced after I finished the main workflow, restructuring the script/program to be presentable and object oriented for production. It was a confusing workaround of adding the functions outside the class and its syntax, but I enjoyed the challenge and organization lesson.

### Lessons learned

I feel more comfortable reading C++, and while I a have a long ways to learn more about memory, pointers, C++ to python APIs, I am looking foward to tackle these new projects.
